# RegiTrust
### Blockchain Based Land Registry App

RegiTrust is designed to streamline the process of land registry using blockchain technology. By leveraging blockchain's properties such as immutability and transparency, the project aims to create a secure and efficient system for recording land ownership and transactions. This not only simplifies the process of accessing land records but also helps in reducing crimes such as scams, bribes, and illegal encroachments.

## Introduction

The primary purpose of the Blockchain Land Registry App is to provide a digital platform for managing land registry records efficiently. By utilizing blockchain technology, the project ensures the integrity and transparency of land ownership records, making it easier to access and verify property information.

## Features

- Cross-platform functionality using [Dart](https://dart.dev/) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).
- Compatibility with the [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) blockchain network.
- Functionality to showcase land area on a map using [Mapbox API](https://www.mapbox.com/).
- Local testing capability using [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache).
- Utilization of blockchain characteristics such as immutability and transparency.
- Transfer of ownership requiring authentication from both parties.
- Generation of a receipt upon successful land transfer.

## Usage

The usage of the Blockchain Land Registry App involves the following steps:
1. Users create their accounts and get verified by land inspectors.
2. Users add land details, including area, price, address, and documents.
3. Land inspectors verify the land details.
4. Users can choose to sell their land, and buyers can send buy requests.
5. The transfer of ownership requires authentication from both parties and generates a receipt.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies, frameworks, and APIs:
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) for cross-platform development.
- [ImageBB API](https://imagebb.com/) for document uploading.
- API for Ethereum to INR conversion.
- [Mapbox API](https://www.mapbox.com/) for capturing map coordinate data.
- Solidity for smart contracts.
- Truffle for connecting smart contracts with the network.
- Ganache as a local development network.
- Polygon AMOY network for testing and development.
